# Storee
## Brief explanation about the project
Our chosen topic is online shop. Online shop is one of the most useful technological development in this modern society. It makes easier for us to do buy and sell activities. Online shop is able to massively increase the level of the world economy. The emergence of applications such as Tokopedia, Shopee, etc in Indonesia has made an increase in the number of online trade transactions increasing greatly. Our application name is STOREE and has a similar purpose to the previously mentioned application, but we offer a unique feature called SWIPEE which is a mainstay and recommendation feature of our application. Through SWIPPE, we can find out whether the user is interested in the items displayed or not. This can be achieved because when the user enters the SWIPEE feature, there will be a timer automatically to calculate how long the user stays on the item displayed. When the user presses the like or add to cart button, the timer count will be stored in the database. From this data, we can infer the type of items that is the most interesting to the user based on the longest timer duration.
